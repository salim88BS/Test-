        <p style="font-size:200%;">This is the <i>best</i> motherfucking website.</p>
        
        <p style="font-size:150%;">Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?</p>
        
        <p>Really, it is.</p>
    
        <p>You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB <r style="color: maroon">motherfuckingwebsite(.com)</r> is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.</p>
        
        <p><u style="color: crimson">WRONG,</u> motherfucker.</p>
        
        <p style="font-size:150%;">The best kick-ass website</p>
        
        <p>Let me describe the real perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past <r style="color: maroon">motherfuckingwebsite:</r></p>
        
            <li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
            <li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <a href="https://google.com">Google home page</a></li>
            <li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)</li>
            <li>Looks <i>almost</i> the same on every screen</li>
            <li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem <r style="font-size: 10%;">well, kind of</r></li>
            <li>It's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">accessible</a>, so everyone can enjoy it <r style="font-size: 10%;">but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</r></li>
            <li>Shit is <i>even more</i> legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style without looking like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a> website</li>
            <li>Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers">IPoAC</a></li>
            <li>Uses only free and open resources. Like this ass-breaking font called "Open Sans" <r style="font-size: 10%;">which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf</r></li>
            <li>It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or any other framework. This website is made with plain HTML, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!</li>
            <li>Doesn't include any tracking service <r style="font-size: 10%;">this website does, but hey, who cares</r></li>
            <li>Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available <i>JUST USE IT.</i></li>
            <li>Use <i>some</i> fucking colors.</li>
            <li>Links don't really need to keep that <r style= color:blue> shitty blue</r> the browser is giving them: nor that violetish color when they are marked as visited. Just give them a <a href="https://www.colorhexa.com/0077aa">nice color</a></li>
        
        <p style="font-size:150%;">Well guess what, motherfucker:</p>
        
        <p>This website is even better than the last <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">guy</a> and the <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">guy before him</a>.</p>

        <p>Why?</p>
         
        <ul>
            <li>It's over a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">secure connection</a> - so nobody can spy what we're serving to you (the page might be different for everyone, pshht!).</li>
            <li>It uses one of the most general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_top-level_domain">gTLDs</a> available out there: .website</li>
            <li>It uses the TLD, too: bestmotherfucking.website, check out <a href="https://domainr.com/">domaine</a> to do something cool too.</li>
            <li>It uses the kickassing <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">et's Encrypt</a>L CA (don't you see the gorgeous green lock?)</li>
            <li>It runs on <a href="https://www.nginx.com/welcome-to-nginx/">nginx</a>: the best fucking web server instead of Apache Server</li>
            <li>It uses <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/js/jquery-2.2.4.min.js">a custom version</a> of the awesome <a href="https://jquery.com/">ultra-lightweight jQuery</a> /s</li>
            <li>It doesn't use a single media query well, <r style="font-size: 10%">not really</r></li>
            <li>It probably doesn't support all the web browsers, but that's the best thing - if the user's browser is outdated he will notice and maybe he will switch from <a href="xhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/hub/4230784/internet-explorer-help">the crap he uses</a> to <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">much cooler browser</a></li>
            <li>It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript [JavaScript logo] , CSS3 [CSS3 logo] and HTML5 [HTML5 Logo]</li>
            <li>It supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">HTTP/2</a></li>
            <li>It includes a Cache-Control header, so you don't waste your precious bandwidth if you visit the website more than once</li>
            <li>It uses <a href="https://matomo.org/">Piwik</a>, a free and Open Source analytics platform (we still love you Google, don't be mad at us)</li>
            <li>It allows uni versal access from every website via <a href="https://enable-cors.org/">CORS</a></li>
            <li>It is <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/">Accessible</a></li>
            <li>It's Open Source, freely available on <a href="https://github.com/denysvitali/thebestmotherfuckingwebsite/">Github</a>, and everybody can contribute to it.</li>
            <li>It uses the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/">WTFPL - Do What the Fuck You Want</a> to Public License, which is pretty clear on what you can and what you can't do:</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul>    
        <p style="font-family: courier; font-size: 90%">0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.</p>
        </ul>
